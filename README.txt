 * All tests pass.
 * The only issue is that the tests for [0-8]+.bad.lang have different formatting in the
 * Strings from the output.txt file. The output is correct, but the runtests.py is different strings as mentioned
 * in the piazza post @44.
 * For example: Instead of "No errors.", "No output." is output on my `make run`
 * or "Error produced on line 55." will be a descriptive error
 * such as "dangling comment at line 55".
 * The line numbers and logic are the same. The output.txt detects the right line numbers
 * and my `make run` passes and fails correctly on the right cases. Overall a fun project.
